"“spool”: If spool=true (which is the default setting), the metrics data "

"to the Splunk spool directory, $SPLUNK_HOME/var/spool/splunk, where the "
"file is indexed \\\n"
"automatically. If spool=false, the file is written to the "
"$SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/splunk \\\n"
"directory. The file remains in this directory unless some form of further"
" automation \\\n"
"or administration is done. \\\n"
"“prefix_field”: Is applicable only when split=true. If specified, any "
"event with that \\\n"
"field missing is ignored. Otherwise, the field value is prefixed to the "
"metric name. \\\n"
"\"host\": The name of the host that you want to specify for the collected"
" metrics data. \\\n"
"Only applicable when spool=true. \\\n"
"\"source\": The name of the source that you want to specify for the "

"Converts search results into metric data and inserts the data into a "

"data point, \\\n"
"the result does not need to be split and can be consumed directly. \\\n"
"Otherwise, each result is spit into multiple metric data points based on "
"the specified \\\n"
"list of dimension fields. \\\n"
"If the '_time' field is present in the results, it is used as the "
"timestamp of the \\\n"
"metric datapoint. If the '_time' field is not present, the current time "
"is used. \\\n"
"Arguments: \\\n"
"“index”: The index where the collected metric data are placed. This "
"argument is required. \\\n"
"“file”: The file name where you want the collected metrics data to be "
"written. \\\n"
"The default file name is a random filename. You can use a timestamp or a "
"random number \\\n"
"for the file name by specifying either file=$timestamp$ or file=$random$."
" \\\n"
"Defaults to $random$_metrics.csv \\\n"
"“split”: Determines how mcollect identifies the measures in an event. "
"Defaults to false. \\\n"
"When split=true, you use <field-list> to identify the dimensions in your "
"search. The  \\\n"
"mcollect command converts any field in your search that is not part of "
"the <field-list> \\\n"
"into a measurement. \\\n"
"When split=false, the measure field or fields need to be explicitly "
"specified by the \\\n"
"search. \\\n"
"* If you have single-metric events, the search must produce results with "
"a \\\n"
"'metric_name' field for the name of the measure and a '_value' field for "
"the \\\n"
"measure's numeric value. \\\n"
"* If you have multiple-metric events, the search must produce results "
"that include \\\n"
"measures that follow this syntax: "
"'metric_name:<metric_name>=<numeric_value>'. \\\n"
"When split=allnums, mcollect treats all numeric fields as metric measures"
" and all \\\n"
"non-numeric fields as dimensions. You can optionally use <field-list> to "
"declare that \\\n"
"certain numeric fields in the events should be treated as dimensions. \\\n"
"“spool”: If spool=true (which is the default setting), the metrics data "
"file is written \\\n"
"to the Splunk spool directory, $SPLUNK_HOME/var/spool/splunk, where the "
"file is indexed \\\n"
"automatically. If spool=false, the file is written to the "
"$SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/splunk \\\n"
"directory. The file remains in this directory unless some form of further"
" automation \\\n"
"or administration is done. \\\n"
"“prefix_field”: Is applicable only when split=true. If specified, any "
"event with that \\\n"
"field missing is ignored. Otherwise, the field value is prefixed to the "
"metric name. \\\n"
"\"host\": The name of the host that you want to specify for the collected"
" metrics data. \\\n"
"Only applicable when spool=true. \\\n"
"\"source\": The name of the source that you want to specify for the "
"collected metrics data. \\\n"
"Defaults to the name of search. \\\n"
"\"sourcetype\": The name of the source type that is specified for the "
"collected metrics \\\n"
"data. This setting defaults to mcollect_stash. License usage is not "
"calculated for \\\n"
"data indexed with the mcollect_stash source type. If you change to a "
"different \\\n"
"source type, the Splunk platform calculates license usage for any data "
"indexed \\\n"
"by the mcollect command. NOTE: Do not change this setting without \\\n"
"assistance from Splunk Professional Services or Splunk Support. Changing "
"the \\\n"
"source type requires a change to the props.conf file. \\\n"
"“marker”: Optional. A string of one or more comma-separated key-value "
"pairs. The Splunk \\\n"
"software adds these key-value pairs to the metric data points in the "
"summary \\\n"
"metric index, so you can use them as markers for easy identification in "
"future \\\n"
"searches of the metric index where they reside. Defaults to empty. \\\n"
"“field-list”: A list of dimension fields. Optional if split=false (the "
"default), required \\\n"
"if split=true. If “field-list” is not specified, all fields are treated "
"as dimensions \\\n"
"for the data point except for the “prefix_field” and internal fields "
"(fields with an \\\n"
"underscore ’_’ prefix). If “field-list” is specified, the list must be "

"1. Normal index data: If you do not supply a FROM clause, we will select "
"from index data in the same way as search. You are restricted to "
"selecting       \\\n"
"from your allowed indexes by role, and you can control exactly which "
"indexes you select from in the WHERE clause. If no indexes are mentioned"
"          \\\n"
"in the WHERE clause search, we will use your default set of indexes. By "
"default, role-based search filters are applied, but can be turned off in "
"limits.conf. \\\n"
"ADVANCED: When the Splunk software indexes data, it segments each event "
"into raw tokens using rules specified in segmenters.conf.    \\\n"
"You may end up with raw tokens that are actually key-value pairs "
"separated by an arbitrary delimiter such as a '='         \\\n"
"symbol. The following search uses the 'walklex' command to find the raw "
"tokens in your index, along with their count:      \\\n"
"'| walklex index=<target-index> | where NOT like(term, \"%::%\") | stats "
"sum(count) by term'                                 \\\n"
"You can use the PREFIX directive in conjunction with 'tstats' to "
"aggregate and group-by these values within the raw        \\\n"
"tokens in your index. For example, say you have a set of raw tokens that "
"feature a numeric value prefixed by 'kpbs=',      \\\n"
"such as kbps=10 or kbps=333. If you run <tstats-func>(PREFIX(kbps)) on "
"those tokens, the  processor returns '=10' and      \\\n"
"'=333', which isn't exactly what you want, because many tstats "
"aggregation functions require purely numeric values.        \\\n"
"So you adjust your search to include the delimiter and run <tstats-"
"func>(PREFIX(kbps=)) on those tokens. This returns      \\\n"
"values of '10' and '333', which are perfect for tstats aggregation "
"functions. \\p\\\\\n"
"2. Data manually collected with 'tscollect': Select from your namespace "
"with 'FROM <namespace>'. If you supplied no namespace to tscollect, the "
"data      \\\n"
"was collected into the dispatch directory of that job. In that case, you "
"would select from that data with 'FROM sid=<tscollect-job-id>'"
"                \\p\\\\\n"
"3. An accelerated datamodel: Select from this accelerated datamodel with "
"'FROM datamodel=<datamodel-name>'"
"                                                \\\n"
"You can provide any number of aggregates to perform, and also have the "
"option of providing a filtering query using the WHERE keyword. This query"
" looks    \\\n"
"like a normal query you would use in the search processor. You can also "
"provide any number of GROUPBY fields. If you are grouping by _time, you "
"should    \\\n"
"supply a timespan with 'span' for grouping the time buckets. This "
"timespan looks like any normal timespan in Splunk, like '1hr' or '3d'. It"
" also supports 'auto'.     \\p\\\\\n"

"“file”: The spool file name where you want the collected metrics data to "

"“span”: Rollup span as a timespan string. The span in minutes has to be a"
" factor \\\n"
"of 60 and in hours should be a factor of 24. Max allowed is 24h or 1d and"
" minimum \\\n"
"is controlled by limits.conf [rollup]/minSpanAllowed setting. A span less"
" than a \\\n"
"minute is not allowed. \\\n"
"“aggregate”: The aggregate stats function to be used to perform rollup. "
"\\\n"
"Valid aggregations supported are avg, count, max, perc<int>, median, min "

"This argument can take single stats function or a \"#\" separated stats "

"Reducing the dimension will reduce the amount of data stored leading to "

"“dimension-list-type”: The type of input dimension list. Used along with "
"\\\n"
